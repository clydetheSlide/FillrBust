#FillRBust
FillRBust is a card and dice game I have enjoyed with real cards and dice.
As a silly exercize I captured the process of playing it in a Python script.
Initially it was just a text driven game, but the exercize grew into a project.
It has become version conrolled as of version 4, when I migrated from
Python2 to Python3. 

It was developed in a Linux environment. 
As a result, the mechanisms to 'install' it are negligible.

It is written in Python, specifically version 3.5.
It uses several modules:

- random
- collections
- copy
- tkinter
- tkinter.scrolledtext
- os
- sys
- getopt
- time
- datetime
- subprocess
- math
- PIL

It has options for using POVray to generate images of a set of dice,
and spd-say to translate text to speech.
